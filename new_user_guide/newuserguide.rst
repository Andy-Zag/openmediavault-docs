Introduction to Openmediavault
##############################

Openmediavault is a File Server / NAS system designed to work on most modern IBM compatible PC systems, to include typical amd64 or i386 PC’s and select ARM devices. Openmediavault (OMV) can be thought of as filling a role similar to Microsoft's Server Essentials, but extends far beyond the role of a basic File Server with additional functionality added VIA plugin’s and Dockers. OMV is designed to work with popular client operating systems and multiple filesystem types, utilizing proven data sharing techniques on small and medium sized Local Area Networks.

In meeting the needs of it's intended users, individuals and small-to-medium-sized businesses, Openmediavault is designed for flexibility.

History
^^^^^^^
Openmediavault's history began with Volker Theile, who was the only active developer of the FreeNAS project by the end of 2009.   Volker became interested in completely rewriting FreeNAS, for use on Linux.  Initially, he named the rewritten package **coreNAS** .  Shortly thereafter, Volker discarded the name **coreNAS** in favor of **Openmediavault** .  Openmediavault's initial release was on 17 October 2011.  It's built upon very mature and proven software layers and is under constant development. Openmediavault relies on the Debian project and uses their system and repositories as a base.  The project focus is on creating and maintaining a stable and extensible NAS system that is intuitive and easy to use.


Purpose
^^^^^^^
The purpose of Openmediavault  (hereafter referred to as “OMV”),  is to provide a NAS system that is highly “extensible” with value added plugin’s and access to numerous Dockers that are desirable and beneficial to home users and small businesses at little to no cost.

One of the ambitions of the OMV project is to make advanced NAS technologies and features available to inexperienced users in an easy to use WEB GUI, thereby making it possible for people, without extensive knowledge of Linux, to gain easy access to advanced technologies.

Getting Involved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If businesses and home users find OMV to be beneficial, consider supporting the project with a modest donation.  While OMV is free, donations to cover Web site costs, hardware for testing, and other unavoidable expenses are needed and very much appreciated.
